# Spec

This project is for managing unique IDs that can be used in various forms.
For example: Referencing 1Password items using IDs like: 1P-f57sd - this is easily
recognizable as a 1Password ID, which can be placed in spreadsheets/etc, and easily searched.

Another example is IDs as a Service for simple hobby image uploaders where I just want to
upload images to Object Storage without building a whole service around it - I can simply
generate unique IDs with this service.
